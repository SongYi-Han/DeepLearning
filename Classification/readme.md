## theory 


### Binary classification
- can be implemented by two layer network with one output (regression network) passed by Sigmoid activation 
- Binary Cross-Entropy Loss 
### Categorical classification
- can be implemented by two layer network with O output passed by SoftMax activation 
  - : O binary classifiers (One-vs-rest) 
- Cross-Entropy Loss
### Evaluation metric : loss vs accuracy
