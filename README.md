# DeepLearning
theory and practical example using Tensorflow and Pytorch

`CNN_basic`: implement CNN and understand Pytorch workflow with CIFAR-10 dataset. 
  
`CNNvsFCN` : compare the performance of two network to classify MNIST dataset  
  
`feature_extraction` : use pre-trained network (ResNet-18) to extract feature of ImageNet dataset
