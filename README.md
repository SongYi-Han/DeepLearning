# DeepLearning
theory and practical example using Tensorflow and Pytorch

`Perceptron` : from simple binary classifier to Perceptron learning algorithm

`CNN_basic`: implement CNN from scratch and understand Pytorch workflow with CIFAR-10 dataset. 
  
`CNNvsFCN` : compare the performance of FCN and CNN to classify MNIST dataset  
  
`feature_extraction` : use pre-trained network (ResNet-18) to extract feature of ImageNet dataset
