## Convolutional layer 
The convolutional layer is used to extract features from the input image. It is a mathematical operation between the input image and the kernel (filter).
Different filters are used to extract different kinds of features. Some common features are given below:

## Pooling layer 
Pooling layers are used to reduce the size of any image while maintaining the most important features. The most common types of pooling layers used are max and average pooling which take the max and the average value respectively from the given size of the filter
